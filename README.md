# What do you suggest?

This is an old experiment which has now gone through a few different incarnations. The code here is the latest version. [See it live](https://whatdoyousuggest.net).

It explores the suggestions made by search engines including Google, Yahoo, Bing and DuckDuckGo. It's basically just some fun with words and the zeitgeist (and how it's mediated by search).
