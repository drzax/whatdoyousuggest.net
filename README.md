# What do you suggest?

This is an old experiment which has now gone through [a few](https://elvery.net/drzax/the-power-of-suggestion) [different](https://elvery.net/drzax/what-do-you-suggest-v2) [incarnations](https://elvery.net/drzax/what-do-you-suggest-again). The code here is the latest version. [See it live](https://whatdoyousuggest.net).

It explores the suggestions made by Google's search engine. It's basically just some fun with words and the zeitgeist (and how it's mediated by Google).

## Deployment

This is deployed using [firebase functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/?authuser=0) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (which is awesome, btw).
